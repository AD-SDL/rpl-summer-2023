## Project description

Argonne SULI 2023 Internship - BIO Workcell Progress

## Diary

### 6/1/2023
- Created internship initiation folder and sample workflow and workcell

### 6/2/2023
- Morning: Created a Working BIO Workflow with the Lionic, Sealer, Pealer, and Hudson Workflow Elements
- Afternoon: Created a Tip_Refill Csv File that can be used with the Hudson Solo on C#

### 6/5/2023
- Morning: Completed all Training Modules on Argonne TMS (except for SEC160 Practical Preparedness for Workplace Violence, which is meeting on July 5th at 10 am)
- Afternoon: Created a parallel workflow python structure on the alp branch in the BIO_Workcell ReadMe

### 6/6/2023
- Morning: Tested Base version Previously Written parallel workflow structure on BIO Workcells
- Afternoon: Developed a more robust parallel workflow structure on python and successfully ran Plate Crane and Peeler in parallel. Had trouble running PlateCrane and Hidex together in parallel because Hidex reader shut down after the request was sent each time.

### 6/7/2023
- Morning: Continued to update Parallel Workflow Structure
- Afternoon: Developed slides for Weekly Meeting

### 6/8/2023
- Morning: Presented Weekly Updates at RPL Meeting
- Afternoon: Completed First Run Through with Less Than 12 Hour Wait Times

### 6/9/2023
- Morning: Incorporated Tip Refill csv Code into the Bio Workflow
- Afternoon: Ran Full Bio Workflow Run-Through for 12 Hours after Completed Potential Errors for Hidex Loading

### 6/12/2023
- Morning: Conducted progress update on the 12 Hour Run and Noticed Hidex Errors
- Afternoon: Developed Diagnosis Test for Hidex Code to Observe when the Machine Times Out

### 6/13/2023
