### Required Safety Courses
Several safety courses are required to be completed in your first couple days working in the RPL. Go to MyArgonne at https://my.anl.gov/ and navigate to Training Management System (TMS) under 'My Apps', then complete the following courses:

For the RPL:
- [ESH195 Personal Protective Equipment](https://apps.inside.anl.gov/que/public/item/WBT/ESH195/splash)
- [CELS102 ESH Plan for working in Rm4302](https://apps.inside.anl.gov/que/public/item/WBT/CELS102/splash)
- [ESH108 Take Building Orientation for Building 240 and Building 446](https://apps.inside.anl.gov/tbd/setCourse.ctrl)
- [ESH141 Portable Hand and Power Tool Safety](https://apps.inside.anl.gov/que/public/item/WBT/ESH141/splash)
- [ESH408 Basic Electrical Safety Awareness](https://apps.inside.anl.gov/que/public/item/WBT/ESH408/splash)

For BIO: 
- [ESH108446 Building Orientation for building 446](https://apps.inside.anl.gov/tbd/setCourse.ctrl?courseNo=ESH108&sectionNo=446)
- [ESH115 Laboratory Safety Training](https://www.eshtraining.anl.gov/courses/esh115/story.html)


You will also need to review this [Work Control Document](https://apps.inside.anl.gov/birt/run?__report=/var/www-data/webapps/birt/prod/reports/wpc/wpc2_worker_package.rptdesign&wcd_id=10058665&__format=pdf&__parameterpage=false) (WCD) before beginning work in the Rapid Prototyping Laboratory. Please let Casey know once you've fully reviewed this document so she can add you to the RPL's list of authorized workers.

### Slack

We will invite you to our slack workspace. Please let us know if you have not been invited to any of the following slack workspaces/channels.

- [Rapid Prototyping Lab Slack Workspace](rapidprototypinglab.slack.com)
  - 2023_students
  - general
  - rpl-code
  - rpl-daily
- [Ramanathan Lab Workspace](ramanathan-lab.slack.com)
  - 2023-summer-interns
  - general
  - journal-club
- [CELS Argonne Workspace](cels-anl.slack.com)
  - sdl-all

### Box

We store a lot of files related to the RPL's robots in our [Box folder](https://anl.app.box.com/folder/189023149157). Casey should invite you to join this folder with your argonne email, but remind her if she forgets. 

### GitHub  

  Each student will need to create their own folder in our [summer 2023 student GitHub repo](https://github.com/AD-SDL/rpl-summer-2023). This is where your daily logs and all weekly status updates will be stored, more details on those below. 

  #### Process for Github

* Fork the <https://github.com/AD-SDL/rpl-summer-2023> repository.  
  * This will create a “copy” of the repository in your own profile.  (ex. <https://github.com/ravescovi/rpl-summer-2023>)

* Clone forked repository to your machine (ex. git clone git@github.com:ravescovi/rpl-summer-2023.git)
* Make code changes on the main (or another branch) in your own forked environment (i.e git commit)
* Push your changes to your own forked repository (git push origin <branch>)
* Then within your fork on github create a “Pull Request”

<img src="https://github.com/AD-SDL/rpl-summer-2023/blob/main/resources/branch1.jpg" width="600"></br>

<img src="https://github.com/AD-SDL/rpl-summer-2023/blob/main/resources/pr1.jpg" width="600"></br>

* You will see that the proposed merge is from ravescovi/rpl-summer-2023:main -> AD-SDL/rpl-summer-2023:main.  Click “Create pull request”

<img src="https://github.com/AD-SDL/rpl-summer-2023/blob/main/resources/pr2.jpg" width="600"></br>

<img src="https://github.com/AD-SDL/rpl-summer-2023/blob/main/resources/pr3.jpg" width="600"></br>

* After the change is approved, click the “Merge pull request”.  This will merge your change into the `AD-SDL/rpl-summer-2023:main along with everyone else’s work in a safe way.

<img src="https://github.com/AD-SDL/rpl-summer-2023/blob/main/resources/pr_merged1.jpg" width="600"></br>

* Repeat the above process for each change you want to make.

> *note:* your own fork will get “out-of-date” with the main AD-SDL/rpl-summer-2023 repository so in your forked repository in GitHub you can click the “Fetch upstream” to have the upstream repository merged into your fork. (see attached image)

## Internship Requirements
### Student meetings
*(Thursdays from 11:15am - 1:15pm in the RPL,bldg 240, room 4302, or virtual)*

- first hour (11:15-12:15) student updates
- second hour (12:15-1:15) RPL technical meeting

Our weekly RPL meeting will be held once per week over the summer. All RPL students are required to attend and present one or two slides about what they've been working on the past week. This should include any progress they've made over the past week, any challenges or questions they have, and their next steps for the project. 

After the weekly meeting, these student update slides should be uploaded to each student's GitHub folder. 

See this [Box Folder](https://anl.app.box.com/folder/165354117265) for examples of student update slides from summer 2022. Last year we stored them on Box but this year they should be added to your GitHub folders. 


### Journal Club 
*(Fridays at 2pm in building 240, room ??? or virtual)*

[Recordings of past journal clubs and sign up sheet](https://anl.app.box.com/folder/132195801817?s=4gaiuz0w2ow4dx71cvtnni4dnv8x8yhu)

 Students will participate in a weekly journal club hosted by the Ramanathan Lab. Each week one student or a pair of students will lead a presentation on a scientific paper that they find interesting or that pertains to their own research. 
- How to journal club intro meeting: *(TODO: date and time)*

- Remind Casey to add you to Teams meeting invite 

### Learn Something New Series
*(Thursdays at 2pm in the RPL)* - Starting date TBD

Each week a different member of the RPL will be presenting a "Learn Something New" presentation designed to help understand some of the various concepts which are used in the RPL every day. These can range anywhere from broad computer science concepts to the functions of a specific robot. If you have anything you'd like to learn more about feel free to suggest a topic to any one of us!

### End of Summer Presentation
Each student will be required to summarize all of their work completed over the course of the summer at the end of their internship in a presentation for the RPL staff and CELS leadership. (If you are already doing a final presentation for SULI/Learning on the Lawn you don't have to present twice. Presenations and/or posters should be uploaded to each student's GitHub folder before the end of the internship.

* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWYqp7iY_Tc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWYqp7iY_Tc)

Please do not add large files to git repositories if possible.

* Please ask your supervisor where to put them.
* Please do not clone a git repository in a directory that is synced with icloud or any other sync mechanism, as files might be deleted.
