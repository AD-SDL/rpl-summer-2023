# Rapid Prototyping Lab - Summer 2023

Howdy folks!!
Welcome to RPL or Rapid Prototyping Lab.

Here are some links and instructions to help you around.

## Getting Started

Checkout this page here. [www.github.com/AD-SDL](AD-SDL)

## Slack

We will invite you to our slack workspace. Please let us know if you have not been invited.

## Student meetings

During the summer we will have a series of meetings

### Recordings

Please find some of the tutorials recorded at our box folder.

* Github with Alex Brace ([link](https://anl.app.box.com/file/981389888412))
* VR with Rory (tbd)

## Python resources -- all over the web, here is a start:
* The Python Tutorial is a good general introduction and reference [https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/]
* Python for Programmers gives a broad perspective that might be interesting [https://python-3-patterns-idioms-test.readthedocs.io/en/latest/PythonForProgrammers.html] 
* A list of additional resources can be found here at [https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Programmers]

## Github

We recommend these tutorials if you are new to git:

* [https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/)
* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWYqp7iY_Tc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWYqp7iY_Tc)

Please do not add large files to git repositories if possible.

* Please ask your supervisor where to put them.
* Please do not clone a git repository in a directory that is synced with icloud or any other sync mechanism, as files might be deleted.

### Process for Github

* Fork the <https://github.com/AD-SDL/rpl-summer-2023> repository.  
  * This will create a “copy” of the repository in your own profile.  (ex. <https://github.com/ravescovi/rpl-summer-2023>)

* Clone forked repository to your machine (ex. git clone git@github.com:ravescovi/rpl-summer-2023.git)
* Make code changes on the main (or another branch) in your own forked environment (i.e git commit)
* Push your changes to your own forked repository (git push origin <branch>)
* Then within your fork on github create a “Pull Request”

<img src="https://github.com/AD-SDL/rpl-summer-2023/blob/main/resources/pr1.jpg" width="600"></br>

* You will see that the proposed merge is from ravescovi/rpl-summer-2023:main -> AD-SDL/rpl-summer-2023:main.  Click “Create pull request”

<img src="https://github.com/AD-SDL/rpl-summer-2023/blob/main/resources/pr3.jpg" width="600"></br>

* After the change is approved, click the “Merge pull request”.  This will merge your change into the `AD-SDL/rpl-summer-2023:main along with everyone else’s work in a safe way.

* Repeat the above process for each change you want to make.

> *note:* your own fork will get “out-of-date” with the main AD-SDL/rpl-summer-2023 repository so in your forked repository in GitHub you can click the “Fetch upstream” to have the upstream repository merged into your fork. (see attached image)

## Daily blogs

This repository is a space to keep your daily blogs and maintain a `README.md` with links to resources that may be shared using non-Git avenues.

* Create a folder named per your name.
* Copy the daily_log_template.md and rename it to README.md
* Update the info on the log
