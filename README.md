# Rapid Prototyping Lab - Summer 2023

Howdy folks!!
Welcome to RPL or Rapid Prototyping Lab.

Here are some links and instructions to help you around.

## Getting Started

- RPL website https://rpl.cels.anl.gov/
- Github home page [www.github.com/AD-SDL](AD-SDL)

### Required Safety Courses
Several safety courses are required to be completed in your first couple days working in the RPL. Go to MyArgonne at https://my.anl.gov/ and navigate to Training Management System (TMS) under 'My Apps', then complete the following courses:

- ESH195 Personal Protective Equipment
- CELS102 ESH Plan for working in Rm4302
- ESH108 Take Building Orientation for Building 240 and Building 446
- ESH141 Portable Hand and Power Tool Safety
- ESH408 Basic Electrical Safety Awareness

## Slack

We will invite you to our slack workspace. Please let us know if you have not been invited.

## Student meetings

During the summer we will have a series of meetings you will be required to attend

### Weekly Journal Club (Day/Time/Room TODO)
Students will participate in a weekly journal club in which each week one or a pair of students will lead a presntation on a paper they find interesting or that pertains to their own research
#### Virtual Link: TODO

### RPL Weekly Meeting (Day/Time TODO)
Students are expected to present a single slide each week on updates, challenges, and next steps for the following week. You can upload this slide to github each week

### Learn Something New Series (Day/Time TODO)
Each week a different member of the RPL will be presenting a "Learn Something New" presentation designed to help understand some of the various concepts which are used in the RPL every day. These can range anywhere from broad computer science concepts to the functions of a specific robot. If you have anything you'd like to learn more about feel free to suggest a topic to any one of us!

#### Learn Something New Recordings

## End of Summer Presentation
Each student will be required to summarize all of their work completed over the course of the Summer at the end of their internship in a presentation for the RPL staff and CELS leadership. (If you are already doing a final presentation for SULI/Learning on the Lawn you don't have to present twice)

## Recordings

Please find some of the tutorials recorded at our box folder.

* Github with Alex Brace ([link](https://anl.app.box.com/file/981389888412))
* VR with Rory (tbd)

## Python resources -- all over the web, here is a start:
* The Python Tutorial is a good general introduction and reference [https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/)
* Python for Programmers gives a broad perspective that might be interesting [https://python-3-patterns-idioms-test.readthedocs.io/en/latest/PythonForProgrammers.html](https://python-3-patterns-idioms-test.readthedocs.io/en/latest/PythonForProgrammers.html) 
* A list of additional resources can be found here at [https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Programmers](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Programmers)

## Github

We recommend these tutorials if you are new to git:

* [https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/)
* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWYqp7iY_Tc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWYqp7iY_Tc)

Please do not add large files to git repositories if possible.

* Please ask your supervisor where to put them.
* Please do not clone a git repository in a directory that is synced with icloud or any other sync mechanism, as files might be deleted.

### Process for Github

* Fork the <https://github.com/AD-SDL/rpl-summer-2023> repository.  
  * This will create a “copy” of the repository in your own profile.  (ex. <https://github.com/ravescovi/rpl-summer-2023>)

* Clone forked repository to your machine (ex. git clone git@github.com:ravescovi/rpl-summer-2023.git)
* Make code changes on the main (or another branch) in your own forked environment (i.e git commit)
* Push your changes to your own forked repository (git push origin <branch>)
* Then within your fork on github create a “Pull Request”

<img src="https://github.com/AD-SDL/rpl-summer-2023/blob/main/resources/branch1.jpg" width="600"></br>

<img src="https://github.com/AD-SDL/rpl-summer-2023/blob/main/resources/pr1.jpg" width="600"></br>

* You will see that the proposed merge is from ravescovi/rpl-summer-2023:main -> AD-SDL/rpl-summer-2023:main.  Click “Create pull request”

<img src="https://github.com/AD-SDL/rpl-summer-2023/blob/main/resources/pr2.jpg" width="600"></br>

<img src="https://github.com/AD-SDL/rpl-summer-2023/blob/main/resources/pr3.jpg" width="600"></br>

* After the change is approved, click the “Merge pull request”.  This will merge your change into the `AD-SDL/rpl-summer-2023:main along with everyone else’s work in a safe way.

<img src="https://github.com/AD-SDL/rpl-summer-2023/blob/main/resources/pr_merged1.jpg" width="600"></br>

* Repeat the above process for each change you want to make.

> *note:* your own fork will get “out-of-date” with the main AD-SDL/rpl-summer-2023 repository so in your forked repository in GitHub you can click the “Fetch upstream” to have the upstream repository merged into your fork. (see attached image)

## Daily blogs

This repository is a space to keep your daily blogs and maintain a `README.md` with links to resources that may be shared using non-Git avenues.

* Create a folder named per your name.
* Copy the daily_log_template.md and rename it to README.md
* Update the info on the log
